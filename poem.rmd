In a world where shadows dance with light,  
Where dawn kisses the last of night,  
A whisper in the wind takes flight,  
And hearts ignite in pure delight.    

Beneath the sky so vast and blue,  
Dreams weave threads of golden hue,  
Mountains stand with steadfast grace,  
Guardians of this sacred space.  

Rivers sing a timeless song,  
Their melodies both fierce and long,  
Through valleys green and forests deep,  
Secrets of the earth they keep.  

Stars above in silent cheer,  
Guide the wanderers far and near,  
Moonlightâ€™s glow on tranquil seas,  
Reflects our hopes, our wildest pleas.  

In gardens where the flowers bloom,  
Fragrances dispel the gloom,  
Each petal tells a story true,  
Of life, of love, of mornings new.  

Birds in flight with wings so free,  
Echo tales of what could be,  
Their freedom sparks a yearning heart,  
To dream, to live, to play its part.  

And so, we walk this path of light,  
With courage born from darkest night,  
Embrace the dawn with spirits high,  
For we are bound to reach the sky.
